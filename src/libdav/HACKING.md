# Hacking

Unit tests and other basic checks can be run with `make check`. This will also
ensure that documentation has no broken links, examples build, etc.

## Integration tests

A small integration tests helper program is available as part of this project.
It runs a sequence of tests on a real `CalDav` server. See
`live_tests/README.md` for full details.
